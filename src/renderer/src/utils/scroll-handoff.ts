// Scroll handoff — who takes the wheel when the box under the cursor cannot.
//
// A nested scroller that reaches its end should let the container behind it
// carry on. Browsers say they do this (`overscroll-behavior: auto` is "chain"),
// but only BETWEEN gestures: Chromium latches a continuous wheel/trackpad
// gesture to whichever box first consumed it, so the rest of a flick that runs
// out of option list is dropped on the floor rather than passed outward. To the
// reader that is a dead spot — the list is a hole in the page you cannot scroll
// past without lifting your fingers and starting again.
//
// The repair is to hand the wheel on ourselves, which needs one decision:
// WHICH box takes it. That decision is this module, kept away from the DOM so
// it can be tested as what it is — arithmetic over a chain of boxes — while
// `useScrollHandoff` does the reading and the scrolling.
//
// `sealed` is how a surface says the scroll stops here. It is read off
// `overscroll-behavior`, so the page states it in CSS, in the platform's own
// vocabulary, once: a popover or a dialog is `contain` and the wheel never
// escapes it, an embedded section says nothing and the wheel travels out to the
// page. Nothing here knows what a popover is.
