// The pure half of the transparency check — a format test, the size to sample
// at, and the scan of the resulting pixels. The DOM half (decoding the image

 * The extensions that CANNOT carry an alpha channel, so a source wearing one is
 * opaque by construction and needs no decoding to prove it. Among the picture
 * formats this app accepts (see `ALLOWED_IMAGE_CONTENT_TYPES`) that is JPEG
 * alone — PNG, WebP, GIF and SVG can all carry one.
 *
 * PICTURE formats, and only those. `"mp4"` was once in this list, put there so
 * a clip would be ruled out before the scan tried to decode it with
 * `new Image()`. But that made this the place picture-vs-clip got decided,
 * from a filename, on a render path, which is the exact guess the `kind` field
 * on a media node was added to retire; and it never worked for the case that
 * mattered, since a clip under a bare object key has no extension to be
 * recognised by. Callers now filter on the item's own `kind` before asking, so
 * nothing that is not a picture reaches here and there is nothing to rule out.
 *
 * Adding a video format back would not be a small extension of this list — it
 * would be reinstating the guess somewhere the caller already has the answer.

 * a thin transparent border on a large picture arrives as 251-ish rather than
 * as a zero, and a threshold of "anything under fully opaque" would then depend
 * on the browser's resampler rounding the same way twice. A genuinely opaque
 * picture stays at exactly 255 however far it is scaled — averaging a field of
