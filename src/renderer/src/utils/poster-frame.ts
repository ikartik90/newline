// Which frame of a clip stands in for it — asked of the frames themselves.
//
// A clip in a note is a moving picture, and everywhere it cannot move it needs
// a still: the poster a <video> shows before it has buffered. The obvious still
// is frame zero, and frame zero is very nearly always the worst one available
// — a screen recording opens on an empty state, a fade-up from the page's own
// background, or a title card, which is to say on the one frame that says
// least about what the clip contains.
//
// So the frame is CHOSEN, by two measurements taken of a dozen frames spread
// across the clip:
//
//   • ENERGY — how much is going on in the frame. A blank opening, a fade
//     through black, a solid plate: all of them measure nothing, and anything
//     with a populated interface in it measures a great deal.
//
//   • STILLNESS — how much the frame has in common with the frames either side
//     of it. A frame caught mid-transition is busy by the first measure and
//     still the wrong one to show: it is a sheet halfway on screen, a list
//     mid-scroll, a cross-fade with two states superimposed. A settled frame
//     is one a viewer would recognise.
//
// The pixel work is deliberately all in here, as plain arrays, so it can be
// reasoned about and tested without a canvas: `capture-poster.ts` is the part
// that needs a browser, and it does nothing but seek, draw and hand the bytes
// over. That split is what lets the rule that picks the frame have tests at
// all.
