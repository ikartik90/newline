/**
 * What a `contain`-fitted picture actually measures inside a box.
 *
 * CSS does this arithmetic itself — `object-fit: contain` letterboxes the
 * element and the browser works the rest out. It is needed where a picture's
 * own corner has to be drawn on a box: a radius on a letterboxed element
 * rounds the LETTERBOX, which is a rounded rectangle of ground with a
 * squared-off picture inside it. Sizing the element to the picture is what
 * puts the corner back on the picture, exactly as `mediaObjectStyle` does it.
 *
 * `null` where the media never recorded its shape, which is every document
 * written before those fields existed. Then there is nothing to compute from,
 * and the caller falls back to filling the box and letting `object-fit` letterbox
 * it — the corner is on the box for those, which is the old behaviour and not
 * a regression.
