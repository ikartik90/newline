// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The mark a scripted walkthrough puts on the pointer events it fires itself,
// and the question every "is the visitor's hand here?" listener has to ask
// before believing one.
//
// A walkthrough that performs a DRAG has no choice but to dispatch the real
// thing: a marquee lives in pointer geometry rather than in a handler you can
// call, so a tour streams `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` at its own
// stand-in cursor. Those events then reach every global listener in the app —
// the cursor-following tooltips, the input-modality tracker, the focus-ring
// switch — each of which reads a pointer move as the visitor moving. A tooltip
// pinned to a button the visitor is still hovering gets dragged across the
// screen by a cursor that isn't theirs.
//
// A property rather than `isTrusted`, which would be the honest discriminator
// in a browser and useless everywhere else: every synthesised event is
// untrusted, including the ones a test fires to stand in for the visitor.
