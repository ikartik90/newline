// How big is this file, really — asked once, of the file itself, at upload.
//
// A media object's SHAPE is the one thing a surface needs before the source has
// arrived and the one thing an unloaded source cannot be asked for. Without it
// a box sized by its picture is zero pixels tall until the bytes land and then
// jolts open under whatever is below it (`mediaReservationStyle`). The answer
// exists exactly once, at the moment a file is picked: the renderer holds the
// file, so it can decode it and read the size straight off the element.
//
// So it is read there and written down — into the object's own metadata, and
// from there into every node that ever points at it. The alternative is
// measuring on every paint, which is precisely what the measurement is supposed
// to make unnecessary: by the time an element can report a size it has already
// loaded, and the box it should have been holding is a box it no longer needs.
//
// The picture/clip fork is the CONTENT TYPE's, the same one `mediaKindOf`
// answers for the element a document renders with. An <img> cannot decode an
// mp4, so guessing wrong here is not a slightly worse measurement — it is no
// measurement at all, for every clip in the library.
