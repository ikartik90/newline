// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A cursor-following tooltip that TEACHES rather than labels. Where a hover
// tooltip names the thing under the pointer for as long as you point at it,
// a hint volunteers a gesture you might not know is there — so it has to be
// self-limiting on both ends: it withdraws on its own after `duration`, and
// `retire()` puts it away for good the moment the gesture is performed. Nobody
// needs to be told how to do the thing they just did.
//
// Positioning is `useCursorTooltip`'s (fixed box + ref + rAF); this hook adds
// only the two clocks. `show(x, y)` seeds it at the pointer, exactly like the
// hover tooltips do, so it opens in place rather than at a stale spot.
//
// `dock()` is the same hint on the same clock with nowhere to point: no cursor
// on the device, so the stylesheet places it at the foot of the screen and the
// returned `docked` is what tells the box to take that placement.
