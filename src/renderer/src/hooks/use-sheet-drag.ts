// gesture starts where the sheet already says "this is the top of me" and the

// fast it was going when it left. The two decisions it feeds (where the sheet

// `enabled` is asked at PRESS TIME rather than subscribed to, because the
// answer is a layout question — is this thing a sheet right now, or a sidebar?
// — and a sidebar's header is dragged by nobody. Reading it here means no media
// query subscription and no re-render on resize.
