// "Is this element properly on screen?" — a live gate with HYSTERESIS, which is
// the whole design. It takes a lot of the element to turn on (70%) and very
// little to stay on (30%), so the two lines are far enough apart that no scroll
// position sits on both: park the element near the edge, jitter a trackpad, and
// the answer holds instead of chattering.
//
// A gate rather than a latch: `false` is the cue to pause whatever the element
// is doing and `true` is the cue to run it again — a clip that plays only while
// it can be seen, say.
//
// The amount is a fraction of the ELEMENT, which stops meaning what you want
// the moment the element is taller than the window — 70% of a 1600px block
// simply cannot be shown in an 800px viewport, and a flat threshold would wait
// forever. `inViewThreshold` caps the ask at what the viewport can actually
// hold, so a tall element triggers on filling the screen instead of never.
