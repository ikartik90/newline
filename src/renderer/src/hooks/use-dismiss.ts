// agree wherever it matters: a surface opened FROM another one mounts second.

// meant for the dialog over it.
//
// The answer has to be taken here, before the press is dispatched anywhere,
// because the dialog is gone by the time the surfaces are asked: React
// delegates keydown from its root, so the dialog's own handler has already run
// and closed it, and the page looks as though there was never a dialog at all.
// `window` is the first stop in the capture phase, ahead of React's root and
// ahead of every surface's listener — and it is first in a test renderer too,
// where React's root is a div and the rest of the order reverses.
