// Which device the user is driving the UI with RIGHT NOW — the "latest mode of
// interaction". A menu opened by typing `/` belongs to the keyboard, and must
// keep belonging to it until the user actually reaches for the mouse; a menu
// opened by clicking belongs to the pointer. Components read this to decide
// whether hover may move a roving highlight, so a cursor that merely happens to
// be parked over the menu can't trap the selection under it.
//
// The subtlety this exists for: a pointer event is NOT proof the pointer moved.
// The engine synthesises `pointerover`/`pointermove` at the unchanged position
// whenever content mounts or scrolls under a stationary cursor — precisely what
// a menu opening under the cursor, or arrow-keying a row into view, does. So a
// pointer event only counts when its coordinates actually CHANGED.
//
// Pointer (not mouse) events, listened for on the document in the CAPTURE
// phase, so the flip is already settled by the time React dispatches the
// `onPointerEnter` it derives from the same `pointerover`. Mouse events are the
// compatibility events that follow the pointer ones — too late to be useful
// here.
