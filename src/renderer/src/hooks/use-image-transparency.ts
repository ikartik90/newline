 * `crossOrigin` — the cell's own <img> is loaded without it, and CORS mode is a
 * property of the request rather than of the response, so the picture on screen
 * is unreadable however permissive the bucket is. That copy comes off the HTTP
 * cache in the ordinary case.
 *
 * And if the CORS load fails, the two reasons it can are told apart by loading
 * the picture the way the cell does. Succeeding there means the bucket serves
 * the image but declines to say who may read it — the answer is unknowable, so
 * the checkerboard is ASSUMED, which is invisible if the picture turns out to
 * be opaque (it covers the ground it stands on). Failing there means the src is
 * simply broken, and there is nothing to stand a ground behind.
